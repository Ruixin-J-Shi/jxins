<p><img src="/images/blog/_a.jpg" title="Title" alt="pic1" /></p>
<p>Building a personal server has always been one of those project I
know I will get on to someday but just don't have the time for it. At
the start of this summer, I finially decided to get on to it. The
process is a bit taunting if you never experienced working with a
server. But trust me, it is not as difficult as you might have
thought.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need">What do I need?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>One always running <strong>Laptop/Desktop</strong> with stable
network connection. The Operation System does not matter here because we
will be using Linux.</p></li>
<li><p>One empty <strong>USB drive</strong> for installing
Linux.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And that is all you need! Yes, you heard me right. No need to rent a
expensive cloud server and paying monthly subscription. As long as you
have a computer with stable network connection you can make your very
own always running personal website up and running!</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>First and formost, remember to back up the important files on your
computer. Once we install the server OS on the computer, we are also
formating all files in that computer, so parepare in advance. The
computer we choose to host our server doesn't have to be a super
powerful one. Considering most personal website are static and doesn't
crazy animation/interaction, a used machaine from couple of years ago or
that old laptop you replaced with the newest Macbook will do the
trick.</p>
<p>For me, I am using a 2014 Mac-mini that I found in the facebook
market with only $40 - a worthy investment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/minis.png" title="pic2" alt="pic2" /></p>
<p>Next, we will need to download the Server OS. In this article, we
will be using the Ubuntu release. Head to the <a
href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server/">Ubuntu Official Website</a>.
The Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS is the latest version at the time of writing this
article so let us just download that. Here LTS stand for
long-term-support but honestly the latest version with nine months
security support would be no different.</p>
<p>You will need some program to burn the iso file into the usb drive.
Here I am using Rufus. There are plenty of options for this step like
Unetbootin, Popsicle, Windows USB/DVD Download Tool, RMPrepUSB, Yumi,
UUByte ISO Burner, or Wintoflash. Any of them would do the trick.</p>
<img src="/images/blog/rufus.png" class="center" alt="pic3" width="400"/>

<p>(rufus interface)</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>After we burn the iso file into the USB drive, we can then start our
installation. Head to your computer. Plug the bootable usb drive into
the computer and restart your computer.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For Mac, you will need to press and hold <strong>Command
(⌘)</strong> and <strong>R</strong> keys while powering on, releasing
them when you see the Apple logo or a spinning globe.</p></li>
<li><p>For Windows, hold down the <strong>Shift key</strong> while
restarting from the Start menu or by holding it down during startup when
prompted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you are inside of security start page, you can then choose the
boot drive to load your Operating System. And we are going to choose to
the boot drive we just created. Follow the Linux installation guide and
install the linux on your device. There are extensive guide on this part
- like this one from <a
href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview">official
Ubuntu wesite</a></p>
<p>Follow any guide should help you get to it. For better performance, I
am assuming we are installing the linux version without a GUI(graphic
user interface).</p>
<h2 id="configure">Configure</h2>
<h3 id="part-1-dns-set-up">Part 1: DNS set up.</h3>
<p>Once you have successfully set up Linux for you server, we can then
start configuring the network part. Here is a little back ground
knowledge.</p>
<p>As long as anyone have your IP address, they can communicate with
your machine. But who want to remember a serious of series long digit
everytime they want to log into a website like 192.168.1.1? Introducing
<strong>DNS</strong> service or <strong>Domain Name System</strong>. DNS
is the backbone of the modern day internet in which it transfer
alphabetical/number strings into a IP address. When you type in <a
href="https://google.com">google.com</a> in your browser, your browser
inquire to the nearest DNS server through your ISP (internet service
provider) to give you back the IP address of a google's server. Then
according to your link for example <a
href="https://www.google.com/maps">google.com/maps</a> or <a
href="https://mail.google.com/mail">mail.google.com/mail</a>, google's
internal DNS server then will direct you to the right server providing
such serive.</p>
<p>We too need to configure our IP address with a DNS server such that
when others type <a
href="https://jxins.duckdns.org">jxins.duckdns.org</a>, they will be
direct to the website hosting this article.</p>
<p>But we do face a challenge here. Most ISPs do not provide static IP
address to general public, which means your IP address will be changing
from time to time. This is because maintaining a static IP address could
be costly for your ISP whereas having a dynamic IP address provide
flexibility, especially when your ISP need to re-routing traffic - which
happened a lot common due to numerous factors like server down
unexpectedly, too many traffic on one point, and etc.</p>
<p>So how should we reslove it？Introducing <strong>DDNS</strong> or
<strong>Dynamic Domain Name System</strong>. DDNS allows you to match a
dynamicly changing IP address to a fix domin. It is the solution for
small scale server exactly like us. Popular DDNS provider are
dnsmadeeasy, Dyn, etc. But I would strongly recommend DuckDNS, the same
DDNS provider that made this server online. DuckDNS takes no charge.
They rely on donation only. Head to <a
href="https://www.duckdns.org/">duckdns.org</a> and sign in through one
of the method they provided. Each account could have max of 5
domains.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/duckdns.png" title="pic4" alt="pic4" /></p>
<p>After login, you can then go to <strong>install</strong> tab and
follow their guide on how to set up the your server. It will first check
if you have installed cron and curl by running:</p>
<pre><code>ps -ef | grep cron
curl</code></pre>
<p>then we will create a new directory named duckdns and add a .sh file
inside:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir duckdns
cd duckdns
vi duck.sh</code></pre>
<p>Inside the duck.sh, copy this text and put it into the file (in vi
you hit the i key to insert, ESC then u to undo) The example below is
for the domain <strong>example</strong>. You can pass a comma separated
(no spaces) list of domains you can if you need to hard code an IP (best
not to - leave it blank and we detect your remote ip) hit ESC then use
use arrow keys to move the cursor x deletes, i puts you back into insert
mode:</p>
<pre><code>echo url=&quot;https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=example&amp;token=[YOUR_TOKEN] ip=&quot; | curl -k -o ~/
duckdns/duck.log -K -</code></pre>
<p>Then we will make this excuatable</p>
<pre><code>vchmod 700 duck.sh</code></pre>
<p>next we will be using the cron process to make the script get run
every 5 minutes</p>
<pre><code>crontab -e</code></pre>
<p>copy this text and paste it at the bottom of the crontab</p>
<pre><code>*/5 * * * * ~/duckdns/duck.sh &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
<p>now save the file (CTRL+o then CTRL+x) lets test the script</p>
<pre><code>./duck.sh</code></pre>
<p>this should simply return to a prompt, we can also see if the last
attempt was successful (OK or bad KO)</p>
<pre><code>cat duck.log</code></pre>
<p>if it is KO check your Token and Domain are correct in the duck.sh
script</p>
<p>This script will push the current IP address to DuckDNS's server on a
5 minute interval, ensuring when our user typed "example.duckdns.org",
they are always direct to the correct IP address no matter how our ISP
changed the IP address of our machine.</p>
<h3 id="part-2-router-set-up">Part 2: Router set up</h3>
<p>Great! we are already half way there. Now that our user know where to
find us, we need to then give them propor response. This part, we need
to do two things. First, we need to set up the router to forward all
incoming traffic that aims to talk to our server to the server. This is
call <strong>Port Forwarding</strong>.</p>
<p>First of all, find out the subnet IP address of your server with this
commend that will show you the MAC address of your server.</p>
<pre><code>ip link show</code></pre>
<p>Head to your Router set up page, it is usually <a
href="http://192.168.0.1/">http://192.168.0.1/</a>. Login to the router
adminstration. In the router’s web UI (often under LAN → DHCP or Address
Reservation), paste in the MAC address. Assign it your chosen IP (e.g.
192.168.1.50).</p>
<p>This step will grant a fix subnet IP address so that when our router
receive incoming traffic, the will sent to this subnet IP address,
specifically, your server. If we don't fix our subnet IP, our router
might assign the subnet IP e.g. 192.168.1.50 to other device. Causing
our router to miss the incomming traffic.</p>
<p>Now that we have a fix subnet IP, we can then do the <strong>Port
Forwarding</strong>. In the router UI navigate to Port Forwarding
(sometimes under “NAT” or “Virtual Servers”).</p>
<p>Create rules like:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Service</th>
      <th>Protocol</th>
      <th>External Port</th>
      <th>Internal IP</th>
      <th>Internal Port</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>SSH</td>
      <td>TCP</td>
      <td>22</td>
      <td>192.168.1.50</td>
      <td>22</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>HTTP (Web)</td>
      <td>TCP</td>
      <td>80</td>
      <td>192.168.1.50</td>
      <td>80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>HTTPS (Web)</td>
      <td>TCP</td>
      <td>443</td>
      <td>192.168.1.50</td>
      <td>443</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>With this set up, whenever our server recieve a SSH/HTTP/HTTPS
request, it will forward the request to our subnet IP which is fix to
our server. Thus, complete the connection between the server and the
user.</p>
<p>Once all of this is set up, we can test our setup by remote connect
our server via SSH. Prior to SSH your server, you do need to install the
server side of SSH since that is not default with every device.</p>
<p>Install server SSH on linux via:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable ssh --now</code></pre>
<p>Once this is done, we can then access our server remotely by SSH on
any machine anywhere. Simply use one of the following:</p>
<pre><code>ssh YOUR_USER_NAME@example.duckdns.org
ssh YOUR_IP_ADDRESS</code></pre>
<p>then enter the password, you can access the shell of your linux
server.</p>
<p>One recommendation I want to make here is to use WinSCP, Cyberduck,
or something equivalent to manage and change files on your server. Since
you can access command line interface via your computer's
bash/shell/terminal/powerShell, you don't need a monitor for your server
anymore. Just plug it in somewhere with a ethernet and a power
connection and that little server would kept running forever.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/winscp.png" title="example" alt="pic6" /></p>
<p>(WinSCP interface)</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/PuTTY.png" title="example" alt="pic7" /></p>
<p>(Here instead of windows' terminal, I am using PuTTY for cmd
interaction)</p>
<h3 id="part-3-server-set-up">Part 3: Server set up.</h3>
<p>Our final step is to set up a server side program that handles
request. Here we choose Nginx to be our server side program. Of course
there are plenty of great options on this part as well, but for
demonstration purposes, we will go with Nginx.</p>
<p>Install Nginx</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx</code></pre>
<p>then start Nginx</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl start nginx</code></pre>
<p>we can verify the Nginx's installation by</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status nginx</code></pre>
<p>you should have saw something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>% sudo systemctl status nginx

<p>A more through <a
href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-nginx#1-overview">installation
of Nginx</a> can be followed throutgh Ubuntu Official website.</p>
<p>Once we successfully install Nginx, when you try to use your browser
to access your server you will see something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/helloNginx.png" title="example"
alt="pic5" /></p>
<p>Now in order to make our own website, we need to modify the default
setting. The defalut website location is at
<strong>/var/www/html/index.html</strong>. You can modify in this
file/directory with whatever html/css/javascript you like. Or, you can
modify the configure file under
<strong>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default</strong> to declear your
website location. Nginx will automaticlly return the html/css file
according to your configuration via correct port. For reference, here is
my configure file.</p>
<p>Here is my setting:</p>
<pre><code>## 1) HTTP :80 default catch‑all  

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

    server_name _;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

## 2) HTTPS :443 for jxins.duckdns.org

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2 ipv6only=on;

    server_name jxins.duckdns.org;
    root        /var/www/html;
    index       index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

    # ---- NEW: directory listing so JS can build the gallery ----
    location /images/ {
        autoindex on;             # &lt;– allow plain HTML listing
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control &quot;public&quot;;
    }

    # regular site files
    location / {
        ssi on;
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    # ---- SSL (managed by Certbot, do NOT edit paths manually) ---
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/jxins.duckdns.org/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/jxins.duckdns.org/privkey.pem;
    include             /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam         /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
}

##  3) HTTP → HTTPS redirect (Certbot)

server {
    if ($host = jxins.duckdns.org) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name jxins.duckdns.org;
    return 404;
}</code></pre>
<p>Up to this point, the your website is all done. Take a break, grab a
coffee, because you are have completed building your first server. Now,
you should be able to access the website on any browser.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next?</h2>
<p>The hardest part of setting the server up is now complete. With this
set of configurations, you can ensure that your website can be seen
anywhere across the public net. All you need to do now is to actually
create the content of your website via html/css/javascript. This
tutorial is meant to help you set up the server so we won't go any
further from here. There are a lot of fantastic blogs on how to make a
beautiful html page. Hope this post did helped you somehow!</p></article>
